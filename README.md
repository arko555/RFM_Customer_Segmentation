RFM Analysis of E-Commerce Transaction Data

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

I have attempted a bunch of different techniques to understand the different customer segments present by analysing their purchase behaviour based on frequency, receny and average spending.
Cohort analysis has also been performed to understand the retention rates of the cutomers based on their first purchase month.

2-stage clustering, K-means and DBSCAN has been used here to segment the customers, and the clusters have been visualised using t-SNE.
